There are several potential issues and guardrails to consider when using Kinesis to load data into AEP. Here are a few:

    Scalability: Kinesis is designed to handle large amounts of data, but it's important to ensure that your AEP instance can handle the amount of data being streamed in.

    Data accuracy: Ensure that the data being streamed is accurate and conforms to the data model defined for AEP. Data quality checks can be put in place to help detect any issues.

    Data retention: Kinesis data is only retained for a limited period of time. Make sure that data is being ingested into AEP in a timely manner to avoid losing valuable data.

    Error handling: Kinesis data ingestion can sometimes fail due to network connectivity issues or other reasons. Ensure that appropriate error handling mechanisms are in place to handle any failures.

    Security: Ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect the data being streamed to AEP. This can include encryption, access control, and other security measures.

    Performance: Ensure that Kinesis and AEP are properly configured for optimal performance. This can include tuning the number of shards in Kinesis and optimizing the configuration of AEP for data ingestion.

    Cost: Streaming data can be expensive, so ensure that you have appropriate cost management strategies in place to avoid unexpected costs.

By considering these potential issues and guardrails, you can help ensure that your Kinesis to AEP data load process is reliable and effective.

Sure, here are some more technical requirements for loading data from Kinesis to AEP:

    Data format: Data being sent to Kinesis must be in a format that can be easily parsed by the Kinesis connector. Similarly, AEP requires data to be in a specific format for ingestion. Ensure that your data is formatted correctly to meet the requirements of both systems.

    Data schema: AEP requires a specific data schema for data ingestion. Make sure that the schema used to collect data at the source matches the schema used in AEP.

    Event tracking: The data being sent to Kinesis should be tracked with unique identifiers so that it can be matched to individual customer profiles in AEP. This allows you to build a complete view of each customer's interactions with your organization.

    Data transformation: Depending on the format of the data being sent to Kinesis, it may be necessary to transform the data before it can be ingested into AEP. This can be done using a variety of tools, including AWS Lambda functions and Adobe I/O Runtime.

    Batch ingestion: If you plan to perform batch ingestion into AEP, you should ensure that the data is collected and organized in a way that allows for easy batching. For example, you might consider using a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream to collect data and store it in an S3 bucket for batching.

    Real-time processing: If you plan to process data in real-time, you should ensure that your Kinesis streams and AEP instances are configured for high throughput and low latency.

    Data retention: You should have a plan in place for how long to retain data in Kinesis and AEP. This can include configuring retention policies and archiving data to long-term storage solutions.

These technical requirements can help ensure that your data load process from Kinesis to AEP is efficient, reliable, and effective.
