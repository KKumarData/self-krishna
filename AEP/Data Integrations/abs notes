give me meeting notes- "in a meeting with customer ABs for AEP data deletion process, it turns out to be that, customer can do cleanup and do incremental custom etl process which is  something available with them to cleanup at source level. but they are looking for the answers for below Qns. 

1. can AEP do the partial updates / incremental updates using AEP process without custom solutions. ?
2. What is the contributions of the Member related 7 datasets to data storage size and profile richness respectively ?
3. as per ABs, All their datasets are enable for profile and number of segments were built on it. so they are not inclined to make any change unless they understand the contibution to profile richness "

4. Field services were part of engagement, so we can give them guidance to analyze the profile report to find the contibution analysis.
