**Integration Name/Description:** Costco IP Warming Integration with Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)

**Purpose/Objective:**
The integration aimed to facilitate IP warming for Costco using Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO). The primary objective was to seamlessly share customer profiles between AEP and WhatCounts (Costco's existing ESP) to support email marketing campaigns during IP warming. The solution needed to handle both batch and real-time scenarios, ensuring effective communication of customer Opt-Ins/Outs and Opt Downs.

**Data Sources:**
- Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) Segment Exports

**Data Destinations:**
- WhatCounts (Costco's existing ESP)

**Integration Type:**
The integration utilized a combination of REST and FTP APIs on the AWS Serverless framework.

**Data Processing Logic:**
1. **Serverless Application Development:** Adobe's Data Engineering team developed a serverless application triggered by AEP Segment Exports. This application transformed the data into a format compatible with WhatCounts, Costco's existing ESP.
   
2. **Dynamic Header Capability:** The solution enabled dynamic header capability, allowing for partitioning of data by two countries, US and CA.

3. **Integration with WhatCounts:** The solution integrated AEP and WhatCounts using REST and FTP APIs on the AWS Serverless framework, facilitating seamless communication of customer profiles between the two platforms.

4. **IP Warming Support:** During IP warming, AEP AJO executed email marketing campaigns in parallel with WhatCounts. This ensured no double-send events occurred throughout the IP warming process.
