**Integration Name/Description:** Rite Aid Data Integration with Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)

**Purpose/Objective:**
The integration aims to enhance Rite Aid's personalization capabilities by leveraging Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) to create personalized, omni-channel journeys. The primary objectives include improving data quality, resolving data integrity issues, and optimizing profile count within license limits.

**Data Sources:**
1. Rite Aid proprietary data sources "1010" and "Dunhumby"
2. Adobe Campaign
3. Point of Sale (POS) streaming data

**Data Destinations:**
1. Adobe Experience Platform (AEP)
2. Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO)

**Integration Type:**
The integration involves a combination of batch processing and real-time streaming data processing.

**Data Processing Logic:**
1. **ETL Pipeline Implementation:** Adobe's Data Engineering team implemented an ETL data pipeline to ingest data from Rite Aid's customer SFTP location. This pipeline transformed data file content to the XDM format compatible with Adobe Experience Platform.
  
2. **Data Quality Checks:** Dynamic data quality checks were added to ensure accurate data attribute structures. This included resolving issues like wrong date formats and UTC format discrepancies.
  
3. **Filtering for Opt-Out Profiles:** A filtering feature was implemented to exclude opt-out profiles from source data before ingestion. This helped maintain profile count within license limits.

4. **Duplicate Email ID Suppression:** Duplicate email ID checks were added to create a suppression list dataset. This dataset served as a reference for Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO), preventing campaigns for card numbers associated with duplicate email identifiers.

5. **Integration with AEP and AJO:** Transformed data from various sources was integrated with Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) and Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO) to enable personalized, omni-channel journeys for Rite Aid customers.
