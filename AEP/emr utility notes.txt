## This script appears to be a set of Python functions that define several functionalities to create and manage EMR clusters using the Boto3 library in the AWS ecosystem.
## 
## The following is a summary of the functionalities:
## 
##   >  The INSTANCE_TYPES dictionary maps EC2 instance types with their corresponding CPU and RAM specifications.
##   >  The ClusterStatus enum defines different states in which a cluster can be.
##   >  The monitor_cluster function monitors an EMR cluster and pushes the cluster ID to an Airflow task instance after the cluster is created.
##   >  The spark_parameters function calculates parameters for an EMR cluster based on EC2 instance types, the number of instances, and the number of cores per executor.
##   >  The create_cluster function creates a new EMR cluster, with a master node and one or more core nodes.
##   >  The get_cluster_dns function gets the DNS name of a given cluster.
##   >  The wait_for_cluster_creation function waits for the cluster to be ready before executing the next step.
##   >  The terminate_cluster function terminates a running EMR cluster.
## 
## The script also imports several Python libraries and functions, such as boto3, logging, requests, time, json, datetime, Enum, and AwsHook.


## The monitor_cluster function is used to monitor the status of an Amazon EMR cluster in AWS. It takes several arguments as inputs, including:
## 
##     aws_conn_id: the ID of the Airflow connection to use to connect to the AWS account.
##     cluster_name: the name of the EMR cluster to monitor.
##     region_name: the name of the AWS region in which the EMR cluster is located.
##     start_date: an optional argument that specifies the earliest creation date for the EMR clusters to search. If this argument is not specified, the function searches for all EMR clusters.
## 
## The monitor_cluster function first creates a connection to the AWS account using the specified aws_conn_id. It then uses the AWS SDK to create an EMR client object, which is used to interact with the EMR service in AWS.
## 
## The function then creates a paginator object that can be used to iterate through the list of EMR clusters in the specified region. If the start_date argument is specified, the paginator is configured to only return EMR clusters that were created on or after the specified date.
## 
## The function then iterates through the pages of EMR clusters returned by the paginator, searching for a cluster with the specified cluster_name. When it finds the cluster, it checks the status of the cluster and returns one of the following values:
## 
##     terminated_cluster: if the EMR cluster is in the process of being terminated or has already been terminated.
##     terminated_with_errors_cluster: if the EMR cluster was terminated with errors.
##     monitor_cluster_steps: if the EMR cluster is in the process of being created and the function needs to push the cluster ID to Xcom for further processing.
##     create_cluster: if no EMR clusters were found with the specified name and a new cluster needs to be created.
## 
## If the function is unable to connect to the AWS account or encounters an unexpected error, it will raise an exception and retry the operation up to 10 times using an exponential backoff algorithm.
## 
## Overall, the monitor_cluster function plays a key role in the orchestration of the EMR cluster creation process. It is responsible for determining when an EMR cluster is ready for use, so that subsequent tasks can be run on the cluster.
