NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements) are the requirements that define the performance, usability, reliability, and other characteristics of a system. Here are some NFRs that may apply to sourcing data from Adobe Analytics Connector to AEP and S3:

    Performance: The data sourcing process should be designed to meet performance requirements. This includes factors such as data volume, frequency of updates, and data processing time. Performance requirements may also include response times for data queries and system availability.

    Security: The data sourcing process should be designed to ensure the security of the data being transferred and stored. This includes encrypting data in transit and at rest, and ensuring that the data is accessed only by authorized users.

    Reliability: The data sourcing process should be reliable and consistent, ensuring that data is accurately and consistently extracted from Adobe Analytics and loaded into AEP and S3.

    Usability: The data sourcing process should be easy to use and intuitive, with clear documentation and user support. This includes ensuring that the data is formatted and organized in a way that is easy to understand and use.

    Scalability: The data sourcing process should be designed to scale up or down as needed to accommodate changes in data volume or other factors. This may include using technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale the data processing and storage infrastructure.

    Data Quality: The data sourcing process should ensure that the data is of high quality, with minimal errors, duplications, and inconsistencies. This includes implementing data validation and cleansing processes to ensure that data is accurate and complete.

By addressing these NFRs in the data sourcing process, you can ensure that the data is accurate, reliable, and meets the needs of the business.
