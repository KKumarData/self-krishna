 Data Architect:

    How Many feeds/datasets are we expecting for each usecases?
	What is the structure and schema of the Adobe Analytics data?	
    What data elements are available and how are they related? XDM Schema and ERD ?
	What data transformation or processing steps are needed before loading the data into AEP?
    Are there any data quality issues that need to be addressed? 
	Have we profiled the data to provide insights that can be used to improve the quality of the data and increase the accuracy of any data processing ?    
    Are there any data access or security requirements that need to be considered?
	What is the level of detail included in the schema?
	What is the process for making changes to the schema?
    How will the schema be versioned and tracked over time?
	
EA: 	
	What are the performance requirements for the AEP and how will the Adobe Analytics data be integrated?
	What are the expected data volumes and how will they be managed in AEP?
    How will the data from Adobe Analytics be integrated with other data sources in the organization?
	
	
Data Owner:

    What are the specific business requirements for the data from Adobe Analytics?
    What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that need to be tracked?

	Data volume:
        Number of records per day, hour, or minute
        Size of data (in bytes, megabytes, gigabytes, etc.)
        Number of data fields or columns

    Data latency:
        Time delay between data collection and processing
