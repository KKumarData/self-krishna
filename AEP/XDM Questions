Here are some XDM schema-related questions that a data engineer could ask a data architect:

    What is the scope of the XDM schema?

    What specific business domains and use cases will the XDM schema cover?
    Will the schema include all data sources, or only a subset?

    What is the granularity of the XDM schema?

    What is the level of detail included in the schema?
    How is the data organized and structured in the schema?
    Are there any specific data models or ontologies that the schema is based on?

    How will the XDM schema be maintained and updated?

    Who will be responsible for updating the schema?
    What is the process for making changes to the schema?
    How will the schema be versioned and tracked over time?

    How will the XDM schema be integrated with other data sources and systems?

    Are there any specific integration requirements for the schema?
    How will data from different sources be mapped to the schema?
    What is the process for ensuring data consistency and quality across different sources?

    What data privacy and security considerations are addressed in the XDM schema?

    What data privacy laws and regulations apply to the data covered by the schema?
    What security measures are in place to protect the data covered by the schema?
    How is data access and usage monitored and audited to ensure compliance with relevant regulations?

By understanding the XDM schema, its scope and structure, and its integration and maintenance requirements, the data engineer can design and implement data pipelines that effectively leverage the schema and provide valuable insights to stakeholders.
