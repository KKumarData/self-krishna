When preparing a data model for the Adobe XDM schema, there are several supporting details that can be added to data elements. These include:

    Description: A description of the data element that provides more context and information about what it represents.

    Example: An example of the data element that shows how it can be used in practice.

    Type: The data type of the element (e.g., string, boolean, integer, date, etc.).

    Constraints: Any constraints or limitations on the data element, such as a maximum length or allowed values.

    Source: The source of the data element, such as where it was collected or generated.

    Context: The context in which the data element is used, such as the business process or customer journey.

    Relationships: Any relationships that the data element has with other elements in the data model, such as parent-child or sibling relationships.

    Data Quality: Information about the quality of the data element, such as whether it is complete, accurate, or up-to-date.

By including these supporting details, you can provide a more comprehensive and useful data model for the Adobe XDM schema.

Here are some specific supporting details that can be added to data elements related to sourcing type, profile attributes, and segmentation:

    Sourcing Type:
        Source System: The system or platform that the data element originated from.
        Data Collection Method: The method used to collect the data element, such as web tracking, mobile app tracking, or offline data import.
