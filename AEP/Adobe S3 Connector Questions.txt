#### As a data engineer,what are  the questions you could ask the data architect, enterprise architect, and data owner to help you source data from Adobe S3 connector?

Sure, here are some questions that a data engineer could ask the data architect, enterprise architect, and data owner to help source data from Adobe S3 connector:

For the Data Owner:

    What is the purpose of the data that needs to be sourced from Adobe S3 connector?

    What is the frequency of data updates and how much data is expected to be transferred from Adobe S3 connector?

    What are the specific use cases for the data that will be sourced from Adobe S3 connector?

    What is the expected data format of the data to be sourced and what transformations or aggregations are needed?

For the Data Architect:

    What are the requirements for the data to be sourced from Adobe S3 connector and where is the data needed?

    What are the performance requirements for the data transfer process and what processing time is acceptable?

    What are the security and access controls that need to be implemented for the data sourced from Adobe S3 connector?

    What are the data validation and cleansing processes needed for ensuring data accuracy and completeness?

For the Enterprise Architect:

    What are the existing data sources and what data architectures are in place for the organization?

    What are the data governance policies and standards that need to be followed while sourcing data from Adobe S3 connector?

    What are the existing data pipelines and what technologies are currently in use for data sourcing?

    What are the expected changes in the future for data sourcing and how can the solution be designed to accommodate these changes?

By asking these questions, a data engineer can gain a better understanding of the requirements and expectations for sourcing data from Adobe S3 connector and design a solution that meets those needs.


#### Sure, here are some NFR (Non-Functional Requirement) questions that a data engineer could ask the data architect, enterprise architect, and data owner to help source data from Adobe S3 connector:

For the Data Owner:

    Performance:

    How frequently do you need the data to be updated from Adobe S3 connector?
    What is the maximum time window you can tolerate for getting the data into the target system?
    How much data do you expect to be transferred and stored?

    Security:

    What are the specific security requirements for transferring data from Adobe S3 connector?
    Are there any compliance requirements that need to be addressed (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?

    Reliability:

    What level of reliability do you expect from the data transfer process?
    What is the maximum acceptable downtime for the data transfer process?
    What are the consequences if the data transfer process fails?

    Usability:

    What are the most important use cases for the data being transferred?
    How will the data be consumed once it is transferred?
    What are the most important metrics and dimensions that should be included in the data transfer process?

For the Data Architect:

    Performance:

    What are the performance requirements for the data transfer process?
    How will data volumes be managed in the target system?
    What is the expected data processing time?

    Security:

    What are the specific security requirements for transferring data from Adobe S3 connector?
    What are the security and access controls that need to be implemented?

    Reliability:

    How will the data transfer process be monitored for reliability?
    What is the expected level of availability for the data transfer process?

    Usability:

    What are the specific data formatting and transformation requirements for the data being transferred?
    What is the expected data structure of the data being transferred?

For the Enterprise Architect:

    Performance:

    What are the performance requirements for the target system that the data will be sourced to?
    How will data volumes be managed in the target system?

    Security:

    What are the specific security requirements for the target system that the data will be sourced to?
    What are the security and access controls that need to be implemented?

    Reliability:

    What is the expected level of availability for the target system that the data will be sourced to?
    How will the data transfer process be monitored for reliability?

    Usability:

    What are the specific data formatting and transformation requirements for the target system?
    What is the expected data structure of the target system?

By addressing these NFR specific questions, you can ensure that the data transfer process meets the requirements and expectations of the data owner, data architect, and enterprise architect, and that the data is accurately and reliably transferred to the target system.
