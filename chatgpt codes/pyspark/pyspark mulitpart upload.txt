#To perform a multi-part upload to an Amazon S3 bucket using PySpark, you can use the putObject method of the S3AFileSystem class. For example, if you have a file called "big_file.txt" that you want to upload to an S3 bucket called "my-bucket", you can use the following code:

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.files import SparkFiles
from pyarrow.fs import S3AFileSystem

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Multi-Part Upload to S3").getOrCreate()

# Read the file into a DataFrame
df = spark.read.text(SparkFiles.get("big_file.txt"))

# Create an S3AFileSystem instance
s3 = S3AFileSystem()

# Upload the file to the S3 bucket in multiple parts
s3.putObject(df.rdd.getNumPartitions(), "my-bucket", "big_file.txt")

spark.stop()


#In this code, we first create a SparkSession and read the "big_file.txt" file into a DataFrame. Then, we create an instance of the S3AFileSystem class and use its putObject method to upload the file to the "my-bucket" S3 bucket in multiple parts.
