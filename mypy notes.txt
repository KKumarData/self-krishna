python is a dynamically typed language as it does evaluate the type compatability of variables/objects etc at runtime. while Java/C evaluates at compile time and stops execution when it encounters incompatible data tyes.

mypy is type checker/hinting/annotation for python itroduced after 3.6
After 3.6/3.9 it has lot improved 
prior to 3.5 it was type hinting using comment (# eg: a #type int )
intall myypy -> pip install mypy
type hinting fails on compile time only when explicitly invoked using mypy library(package). eg : mypy ./src


from typing import Dict, List, Set, Optional, TypeVar,Callable, Union, Any etc can be used
reveal_type(obj) helps to reveal the type mypy is thinking. --- used only to evaluate.. should be deleted from code before checkin
reveal_locals(obj) helps to reveal the type mypy of local variables. --- used only to evaluate.. should be deleted from code before checkin

It can be more commonly used when we check-in to GIT or integrated with CI pipelines to enable code quality checking
It can be integrated with pycharm,Visual Studio as well


Google, microsoft and facebook as their own static type checker modules like pytype,pyright,typere etc
