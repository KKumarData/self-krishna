# Here are some critical scenarios that you may need to consider when working with PySpark:

# Handling missing or invalid data: Spark data processing functions are designed to handle missing or invalid data, but you may still need to consider how to handle these cases in your code. This can include handling missing values, dealing with invalid data types, and handling data quality issues.

# Handling large datasets: Spark is designed to process large datasets efficiently, but you may still need to consider how to optimize your code for performance when working with very large datasets. This can include using partitioning and parallelism, optimizing memory usage, and using more efficient algorithms.

# Handling errors and exceptions: Spark is designed to be fault-tolerant, but you may still need to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during data processing. This can include handling connection timeouts, handling invalid data, and handling errors in user-defined functions.

# Maintaining data integrity: When working with data, it's important to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent. This can include handling data inconsistencies, ensuring data quality, and handling data dependencies.

# Ensuring data security: When working with sensitive data, it's important to ensure that the data is secure and protected. This can include encrypting data at rest and in transit, implementing access controls, and following data privacy regulations.

# Here is an example of how you can write a pytest to handle missing or invalid data in a Spark DataFrame, taking in the DataFrame, column names, and test scenario (missing or invalid) as arguments:
# ##############################################################################################################################################
def test_handle_missing_data(spark_session, df, column_names, test_scenario):
    # Create a test DataFrame with missing or invalid data
    if test_scenario == 'missing':
        df = df.na.fill({column_names[0]: 'unknown'})
    elif test_scenario == 'invalid':
        df = df.filter(df[column_names[0]] != 'invalid')
    
    # Assert that the resulting DataFrame is correct
    assert df.count() == 2
    assert df.select(column_names[0]).collect() == [Row(column_names[0]='unknown'), Row(column_names[0]='unknown')]

# This test case takes in a DataFrame, a list of column names, and a test scenario (either 'missing' or 'invalid') as arguments. It then applies the appropriate transformations to handle the missing or invalid data in the specified column, and asserts that the resulting DataFrame has the correct number of rows and that the specified column has the expected values.

#You can adapt this example to suit your specific needs and use it as a starting point for writing your own tests.


#Here is an example of how you can write a pytest to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent in a Spark DataFrame:

def test_data_accuracy_and_consistency(spark_session, df, column_names):
    # Check that all columns have the expected data types
    assert df.dtypes == [(column_names[0], 'int'), (column_names[1], 'string'), (column_names[2], 'string'), (column_names[3], 'int')]

    # Check that there are no null values in any of the columns
    for column_name in column_names:
        assert df.filter(df[column_name].isNull()).count() == 0

    # Check that there are no duplicate rows
    assert df.count() == df.dropDuplicates().count()
    
    # Check that the values in the specified columns are within the expected range
    assert df.filter((df[column_names[0]] < 0) | (df[column_names[0]] > 100)).count() == 0
    assert df.filter((df[column_names[3]] < 0) | (df[column_names[3]] > 100)).count() == 0

# This test case takes in a DataFrame and a list of column names as arguments. It performs several checks to ensure that the data is accurate and consistent, including checking the data types of the columns, checking for null values, checking for duplicate rows, and checking that the values in certain columns are within a specified range.
