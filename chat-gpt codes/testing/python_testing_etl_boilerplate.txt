#ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a process for extracting data from a variety of sources, transforming it into a format that is suitable for analysis or further processing, and loading it into a destination such as a database or data warehouse. Here are some test scenarios and examples of pytest code that you can use to test an ETL process in Python:
#
#Test the extraction of data from various sources:
#Test that the ETL process can successfully extract data from a variety of sources, such as flat files, databases, APIs, and web scraping.
#Test that the ETL process can handle different types of data, such as structured and unstructured data.
#Test that the ETL process can handle errors and exceptions when extracting data from a source, such as a connection timeout or a 404 error.
 
def test_extract():
    # Test extracting data from a flat file
    data = etl.extract('data.csv')
    assert data is not None
    assert isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame)
    
    # Test extracting data from a database
    data = etl.extract('database', query='SELECT * FROM table')
    assert data is not None
    assert isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame)
    
    # Test extracting data from an API
    data = etl.extract('api', endpoint='/users')
    assert data is not None
    assert isinstance(data, pd.DataFrame)
    
    # Test handling errors when extracting data
    with pytest.raises(ETLError):
        etl.extract('invalid_source')
#Test the transformation of data:
#Test that the ETL process can perform various transformations on the data, such as filtering, sorting, aggregation, and pivoting.
#Test that the ETL process can handle missing or invalid data and apply the appropriate transformations or error handling.
#Test that the ETL process can handle large datasets and perform transformations efficiently.
 
def test_transform():
    # Test filtering data
    data = etl.transform(data, filter='age > 18')
    assert data['age'].min() > 18
    
    # Test sorting data
    data = etl.transform(data, sort='age')
    assert data['age'].is_monotonic_increasing
    
    # Test aggregating data
    data = etl.transform(data, aggregate=['mean', 'min', 'max'], groupby='gender')
    assert data.columns.isin(['mean', 'min', 'max']).all()
    
    # Test pivoting data
    data = etl.transform(data, pivot='gender')
    assert 'male' in data.columns
    assert 'female' in data.columns
    
    # Test handling missing data
    data = etl.transform(data, missing='mean')
    assert data.isnull().sum().sum() == 0
    
    # Test handling invalid data
    data = etl.transform(data, invalid='ignore')
    assert data.shape[0] == data.dropna().shape[0]
#Test the loading of data:
#Test that the ETL process can load the transformed data into the destination, such as a database or data warehouse.
#Test that the ETL process can handle errors


# To test that a specific column in a Spark DataFrame has a specific data type, you can modify the test function to take the column name and expected data type as arguments. Here's an example of how you can do this:

def test_column_type(df, col, dtype):
    # Check that the specified column has the expected data type
    assert df[col].dtype == dtype


def test_etl():
    # Load the data into a Spark DataFrame
    df = etl.load('data.csv')
    
    # Test that the 'age' column is numeric
    test_column_type(df, 'age', 'numeric')
    
    # Test that the 'name' column is string
    test_column_type(df, 'name', 'string')
    
    
    

#To assert that a given output is a Spark DataFrame in a pytest test case, you can use the isinstance function and check that the output is an instance of the DataFrame class from the pyspark.sql module. Here's an example of how you can do this:

from pyspark.sql import DataFrame

def test_output_is_dataframe(output):
    # Assert that the output is a Spark DataFrame
    assert isinstance(output, DataFrame)

#You can then use this test function in your pytest suite by calling it and passing in the output that you want to test as an argument. For example:

def test_etl():
    # Load the data into a Spark DataFrame
    df = etl.load('data.csv')
    
    # Test that the output of the transform function is a Spark DataFrame
    output = etl.transform(df, filter='age > 18')
    test_output_is_dataframe(output)

#This test will pass if the output is a Spark DataFrame, and it will fail if the output is not a DataFrame.
