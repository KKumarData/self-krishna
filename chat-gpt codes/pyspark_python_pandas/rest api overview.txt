concept behind data upload to saas application using rest api:

    SaaS (Software as a Service) applications are cloud-based software that can be accessed over the internet and are typically used by businesses on a subscription basis. They often have APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow users to access and manipulate data in the application programmatically, using REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs.
    
    REST APIs use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on data stored in the application. For example, a user might use a POST request to upload data to the application, a GET request to retrieve data from the application, a PUT request to update data in the application, or a DELETE request to delete data from the application.
    
    To upload data to a SaaS application using a REST API, the user typically needs to:
    
    Identify the endpoint (URL) of the API that corresponds to the desired operation (e.g., /api/data/upload).
    
    Determine the format of the data that the API expects. This is often specified in the API documentation.
    
    Construct a request payload containing the data in the required format.
    
    Issue a POST request to the endpoint with the payload as the request body.
    
    If the request is successful, the API will return a response containing a status code indicating the success or failure of the operation, as well as any relevant data (e.g., the uploaded data).
    
    It is often useful to use a client library or other tool to simplify the process of interacting with a REST API. These tools can handle tasks such as formatting the request payload, parsing the response, and handling errors, allowing the user to focus on the data and the desired operations.
    
Popular Python libraries :	
    There are several popular Python libraries that can be used to upload and download data to and from SaaS applications using REST APIs. Some examples include:
    
    Requests: This is a popular library for making HTTP requests in Python. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for sending requests and handling responses, and it is widely used in many different contexts.
    
    httplib2: This is a low-level library for working with HTTP in Python. It provides a number of advanced features, such as support for caching and authentication, and it is often used as a foundation for more specialized libraries.
    
    aiohttp: This is an asyncio-based library for working with HTTP in Python. It is designed to be used in asyncio programs and provides a number of features for handling HTTP requests and responses in an async manner.
    
    PycURL: This is a Python binding for the libcurl library, which is a widely used library for working with HTTP and other internet protocols. PycURL provides a number of advanced features and is often used in high-performance applications.
    
    urllib3: This is a library for working with HTTP in Python that is part of the Python standard library. It provides a number of utility functions for handling HTTP requests and responses and is often used as a building block for more specialized libraries.
    
    There are many other libraries available as well, each with its own set of features and capabilities. The best choice will depend on the specific needs of your application.
    
To create a data application to deal with a SaaS application for data processing, you will likely need to consider the following prerequisites:
    
    Familiarity with the SaaS application: You will need to have a good understanding of the features and capabilities of the SaaS application, as well as any relevant data structures and APIs. This may require reviewing the application's documentation and possibly experimenting with the application itself.
    
    Familiarity with the programming language and tools: You will need to have a good understanding of the programming language and tools that you will be using to create the data application. This may include knowledge of relevant libraries, frameworks, and development environments.
    
    Familiarity with data processing concepts: You will need to have a good understanding of data processing concepts, such as data transformation, data cleansing, data integration, and data analysis. This will help you design and implement effective data processing pipelines.
    
    Familiarity with data storage and access: You will need to have a good understanding of data storage and access technologies, such as databases and file systems. This will help you design and implement effective data storage and access solutions for your data application.
    
    Familiarity with security and privacy: You will need to have a good understanding of security and privacy best practices, as well as any relevant laws and regulations. This will help you ensure that your data application is secure and compliant.
    
    Familiarity with testing and debugging: You will need to have a good understanding of testing and debugging techniques, as well as relevant tools and libraries. This will help you ensure that your data application is reliable and performs well.
    
    In addition to these prerequisites, you may also need to consider other factors such as the scalability, maintainability, and performance of your data application.
