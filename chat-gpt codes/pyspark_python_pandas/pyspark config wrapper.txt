his config file specifies the following configuration settings:

Spark-specific settings, such as the master URL, the app name, and the memory and cores to use for the driver and executors.
Logging settings, including the logging level and the output destination (e.g. console or a file).
Input and output paths for the data used by the PySpark application.

To consume a config file in a PySpark application, you can use the SparkConf and SparkSession classes from the pyspark.sql module.
The SparkConf class allows you to set configuration settings for a Spark application, and the SparkSession class provides a single point of entry to interact with Spark functionality.

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession, SparkConf
import json

# Load the config file
with open("config.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)

# Set the Spark configuration settings
conf = SparkConf()
for key, value in config["spark"].items():
    conf.set(key, value)

# Create the SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.config(conf=conf).getOrCreate()

# Use the SparkSession to read data from the input path
df = spark.read.csv(config["input"]["path"])

# Perform some data processing or transformation
# ...

# Write the results to the output path
df.write.csv(config["output"]["path"])

You can put the config file in any location that is accessible to your PySpark application.
A common practice is to include the config file in the project root directory, or in a separate config directory within the project.
