A fallback method is a secondary or backup method that is used in the event of failure of the primary method. In the context of message or event processing, a fallback method can be used in case the primary processing method encounters an error or fails to produce the expected results.

For example, in a system that processes incoming messages, the primary method might be to parse and process the messages and store the results in a database. If there is a problem with the database, the system might use a fallback method to store the messages in a local file until the database is available again.

In general, fallback methods provide a mechanism for handling exceptions or unexpected events and allow systems to continue to operate even if the primary processing method fails. Fallback methods can help ensure the reliability and robustness of a system by providing a way to recover from failures and maintain system functionality.
