#####to merge multiple CSV files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. 

import boto3
import csv

s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List to store the final merged data
merged_data = []

# List the names of the CSV files that you want to merge
filenames = ['file1.csv', 'file2.csv', 'file3.csv']

# Loop through the list of filenames and read the data from each file
for filename in filenames:
    # Read the contents of the file
    response = s3.get_object(Bucket='my-bucket', Key=filename)
    file_content = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')

    # Convert the file content to a list of dictionaries
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file_content.splitlines())
    data = list(csv_reader)

    # Append the data to the merged_data list
    merged_data += data

# Write the merged data to a new CSV file
with open('merged_file.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:
    fieldnames = ['field1', 'field2', 'field3']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerows(merged_data)

# Upload the merged file to S3
s3.upload_file('merged_file.csv', 'my-bucket', 'merged_file.csv')


#### This code reads the contents of each CSV file from the S3 bucket, converts the data to a list of dictionaries, and appends the data to the merged_data list. Then it writes the merged_data list to a new CSV file and uploads the file back to the S3 bucket.
