SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) are two popular types of web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow communication between systems.

SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while REST is a set of architectural constraints and design principles that define how web standards, such as HTTP and URI, should be used.

SOAP uses XML as its message format, while REST can use XML, JSON or other formats. SOAP is typically heavier and less flexible than REST, but provides more security features, such as built-in error handling. REST is typically faster and more lightweight, and is often preferred for use with mobile devices and web-based applications.

In summary, SOAP is better suited for complex, tightly-coupled systems, while REST is better suited for loosely-coupled, less complex systems.

python to post soap requests

import requests

url = "https://example.com/soap_endpoint"

headers = {'content-type': 'text/xml'}

payload = """
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <ns:yourRequest xmlns:ns="http://your.namespace.com">
         <ns:requestData>request data</ns:requestData>
      </ns:yourRequest>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
"""

response = requests.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers)

print(response.text)


In this example, the requests.post() method is used to make a POST request to the specified URL. The headers parameter is set to include the content-type header, which indicates that the payload is in XML format. The payload variable contains the SOAP request in XML format, which is passed as the data parameter in the requests.post() method.

The response from the server is stored in the response variable and can be accessed using the response.text property. You can also check the status code of the response using response.status_code to determine if the request was successful.


import requests

class SoapClient:
    def __init__(self, endpoint):
        self.endpoint = endpoint

    def send_request(self, payload):
        headers = {'content-type': 'text/xml'}
        response = requests.post(self.endpoint, data=payload, headers=headers)
        return self.process_response(response)

    def process_response(self, response):
        if response.status_code == 200:
            return response.text
        else:
            return self.fallback_method()

    def fallback_method(self):
        return "Request failed. Falling back to default response."

client = SoapClient("https://example.com/soap_endpoint")

payload = """
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <ns:yourRequest xmlns:ns="http://your.namespace.com">
         <ns:requestData>request data</ns:requestData>
      </ns:yourRequest>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
"""

response = client.send_request(payload)

print(response)

In this example, the SoapClient class is used to wrap the requests library and provide a convenient interface for sending SOAP requests and processing the responses. The send_request method uses the requests.post method to send the SOAP request, and the process_response method checks the status code of the response and returns the response text if the status code is 200 (success), or calls the fallback_method if the status code indicates a failure. The fallback_method provides a default response in case the request fails.

The client is created by instantiating the SoapClient class with the endpoint URL, and the send_request method is called to send the SOAP request and receive the response. The response is then printed to the console.
