## There are a few ways you can promote Airflow DAGs to higher environments:
## 
## Use Git version control: One way to promote DAGs to higher environments is to use Git version control and a branching strategy. For example, you can use a Git branching model like GitFlow, which has a develop branch for active development and a master branch for production-ready code. When a DAG is ready to be promoted to a higher environment, you can merge the changes from the develop branch into the master branch and push the master branch to the production environment.
## 
## Use the Airflow CLI: Another way to promote DAGs is to use the Airflow CLI and the airflow backfill command. The airflow backfill command allows you to run a DAG over a specified time range and with a specified level of concurrency. You can use this command to promote a DAG to a higher environment by running it in the higher environment with the --local flag.
## 
## Export and import DAGs: You can also use the airflow export and airflow import commands to export a DAG from one environment and import it into another environment.


# To export a DAG using the Airflow CLI, you can use the airflow export command and specify the following parameters:
# 
# dag_id: The ID of the DAG to export.
# execution_date: The execution date of the DAG run to export.
# output_file: The file to which the exported DAG will be written.
# recursive: Whether to include the dependencies of the DAG in the exported file.
# Here's an example of how you can use the airflow export command with most of the possible parameters:

 
airflow export \
    --dag_id sample_dag \
    --execution_date 2021-01-01T00:00:00 \
    --output_file /path/to/output/file.yml \
    --recursive

## This command will export the sample_dag DAG with an execution date of 2021-01-01T00:00:00 to the file /path/to/output/file.yml. If --recursive is set to True, the dependencies of the DAG will also be included in the exported file.



## To import a DAG using the Airflow CLI, you can use the airflow import command and specify the following parameters:
## 
## dag_id: The ID of the DAG to import.
## input_file: The file from which the DAG will be imported.
## Here's an example of how you can use the airflow import command:


airflow import \
    --dag_id sample_dag \
    --input_file /path/to/input/file.yml


## This command will import the DAG from the file /path/to/input/file.yml and give it the ID sample_dag. The DAG will be added to the Airflow instance, and you can view and trigger it from the Airflow web UI.
