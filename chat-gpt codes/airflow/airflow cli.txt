Here are some examples of how you can use the Apache Airflow CLI to run tasks with different scenarios and arguments:

To run a task with the default arguments and options:
	airflow run my_dag my_task
	
To run a task with a specific execution date and time:
	airflow run my_dag my_task execution_date=2022-12-01T00:00:00
	
To run a task with a specific run id:
	airflow run my_dag my_task run_id=my_run_id
	
To run a task with a specific execution date and time, and pass an argument to the task:
	airflow run my_dag my_task execution_date=2022-12-01T00:00:00 -- my_arg=123
	
To run a task with a specific run id, and pass multiple arguments to the task:
	airflow run my_dag my_task run_id=my_run_id --arg1=value1 --arg2=value2 --arg3=value3
	
To run a task and force it to bypass any dependencies or checks:
	airflow run my_dag my_task execution_date=2022-12-01T00:00:00 --force

You can use the airflow run command with different combinations of arguments and options to control how tasks are executed in Airflow. 
You can also use the --help option to get a list of all available options and arguments for the airflow run command.
