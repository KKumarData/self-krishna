## Here are the minimum version requirements for the specific operators and libraries used in the example DAG I provided:
## 
## S3FileTransformOperator: Available in Airflow 2.0 and above.
## SNSPublishOperator: Available in Airflow 2.0 and above.
## PostgresOperator: Available in Airflow 1.10 and above.
## In addition to these minimum version requirements, you will also need to make sure that you are using a version of Airflow that is compatible with the version of Python that you are using, as well as the version of any other libraries or services that you are using in your DAG.
## 
## It is always a good idea to use the latest stable version of Apache Airflow, as it will include the most up-to-date features and bug fixes. You can find the latest stable version of Airflow on the Apache Airflow website (https://airflow.apache.org/) or by checking the PyPI package index (https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/).

## This DAG has three tasks:
## 
## process_s3_file: This task processes a file in an S3 bucket using a Spark call.
## load_to_sns: This task loads the data from the processed S3 file to an SNS topic.
## load_to_rds: This task loads the data from the processed S3 file to an RDS database.
## The tasks are linked in a linear fashion, so load_to_sns depends on the completion of process_s3_file, and load_to_rds depends on the completion of load_to_sns.
## 
## You will need to replace the process_s3_file, load_to_sns, and load_to_rds functions with your own code to perform the desired processing and loading. You will also need to
