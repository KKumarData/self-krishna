Create a VPC and subnets in your AWS account. This will define the network where your AWS Glue resources will be deployed.

Create an internet gateway and attach it to your VPC. This will allow your VPC to access the internet.

Create a NAT gateway and attach it to your VPC. This will allow your private subnets to access the internet for services such as AWS Glue job runs.

Create a security group for your AWS Glue resources. This will define the network access rules for your AWS Glue development endpoint, job, and other resources.

Associate the security group with your VPC and subnets. This will apply the network access rules to your VPC and subnets.

Configure the VPC and subnet settings for your AWS Glue resources. This will allow the resources to be deployed in your VPC and subnets.

Create an AWS Glue Data Catalog, development endpoint, security configuration, IAM role, and connection as described in the previous section.

Develop and test your ETL scripts in the development endpoint, and create an AWS Glue job to run the scripts.

Add triggers to the AWS Glue job to specify when and how often the job should be run.

Monitor the job runs and the data in your data lake to ensure that the ETL process is working as expected.
