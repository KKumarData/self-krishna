To find a file in an S3 bucket with a specific name using a wildcard pattern, you can use the following Python code:

import boto3
import fnmatch

# Replace "bucket_name" with the name of your S3 bucket
bucket_name = "bucket_name"

# Replace "file_pattern" with the wildcard pattern for the file you are searching for
# For example, "*.txt" will match all files with a ".txt" extension
file_pattern = "file_pattern"

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List all objects in the bucket
objects = s3.list_objects(Bucket=bucket_name)

# Iterate through the objects and check if the file name matches the pattern
for obj in objects['Contents']:
    if fnmatch.fnmatch(obj['Key'], file_pattern):
        # The file was found
        print(f"File {obj['Key']} was found in the bucket")

# If the file was not found, print a message
print(f"No files matching the pattern {file_pattern} were found in the bucket")

This code will list all objects in the specified S3 bucket and check if any of them match the specified wildcard pattern. If a matching file is found, it will print a message indicating that the file was found. If no matching files are found, it will print a message indicating that no matching files were found.
